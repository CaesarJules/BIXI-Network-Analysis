# BIXI-Network-Analysis
A Study On Montreal’s Bike Sharing Network, BIXI
[Study in Progress]

### Abstract:

Montreal, with its booming growth in recent years, is a great demonstration of the urban mobility challenge: with congestion, construction, parking difficulties and weather / environmental conditions to cite a few. To contribute combatting this challenge, BIXI, the first large-scale bike sharing network in North America at the time, was launched in May 2009. With over 5 million annual rides, it is without doubt contributing positively to the city’s development. However, with its increasing adoption, the network has become frustrating to use, with stations often being empty when you need a bike, or full when you need to return one at peak usage times. Through this project, we want to analyze the tens of thousands trips that occur each day. We want to see how this data can be used to provide environmental and socio-economic insights and better understand the habits of Montrealers to understand how this phenomenon occurs. We would also like to perform some flow and trip predictions and attempt to propose a solution to the issue of empty and full stations.
