# BIXI-Network-Analysis
A Study On Montreal’s Bike Sharing Network, BIXI

### Abstract:

Montreal, which has been experiencing a booming growth in the recent years, is a great demonstration of the urban mobility challenge: with congestion, construction, parking difficulties and weather / environmental conditions to cite a few. 

To contribute combatting this challenge, the Public Bike System Company launched BIXI in May 2009, the first large-scale bike sharing network in North America at the time. With over 5 million annual rides, it is without doubt that this shared, green mobility transportation method contributes positively to the city’s development.

However, despite the positive impact of this network, it can be frustrating to use. Every morning when I go to my nearest BIXI station to ride a bike to university it is empty. The story repeats when after finally finding and riding my BIXI bike to McGill, I find the station full, with no space left for my bike…
Through this project, I want to analyze the tens of thousands trips that occur each day. I want to see how this data can be used to provide environmental and socio-economic insights, better understand the habits of Montrealers and understand how and why this phenomenon occurs. I would also like to perform some flow predictions on the network and attempt to propose a solution to overcome the issue of empty and full station, through trip recommendation models and bike station rebalancing operations.
